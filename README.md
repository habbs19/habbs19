I'm Habib Shakibanejad, I am a full-stack developer with a passion for creating high-performance and scalable web applications. My expertise in C#, MS SQL, React, Blazor, TypeScript, CSS, and HTML allows me to design and build complete web solutions from the back-end to the front-end. I have a strong background in SQL development and experience in designing and maintaining complex database systems. My proficiency in C# and MS SQL enables me to write efficient and maintainable code for both the back-end and front-end of web applications. I also have hands-on experience in using React and Blazor to build responsive and dynamic user interfaces, as well as TypeScript to write maintainable and scalable code. Additionally, my skills in CSS and HTML allow me to create visually appealing and user-friendly web pages. I am always looking to expand my knowledge and skills, and am excited to work on new and challenging projects.
